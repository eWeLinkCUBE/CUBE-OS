2. Open the device's **control panel** and tap the **gear icon**.
3. In the device settings page, scroll down to **“Bridge”** and tap it.
4. This will lead you to the settings page of the bridge that connects your devices.  
Scroll to the bottom and tap **“Turn On Pairing Mode.”**
5. Copy the code and follow the pairing guide on the **CUBE OS** page.
